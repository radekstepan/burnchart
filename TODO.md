# TODO

fix: ractivejs/ractive/23 value is not in recognized format

## Nice to have

- do not refetch milestones when navigating from repos
- convert `x` to a Date so we don't convert multiple times over
- render milestone end date as a tick if overdue; https://apexcharts.com/docs/annotations/
- back button to navigate away from milestone page
- d3/d3 has no milestones
- use Vercel and Next.js Github auth instead of Firebase
- semantic-release, GitHub actions, push to npm
