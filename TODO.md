# TODO

- chart
  - show ideal progress
  - show trendline
- an issue could have been closed before a milestone was created (carry over config?)
- fetch data on each page rather than using the cache (unless we are on a milestone page)

## Nice to have

- convert `x` to a Date so we don't convert multiple times over
- render milestone end date as a tick if overdue; https://apexcharts.com/docs/annotations/
- show progess chart on milestone page
- back button to navigate away from milestone page
