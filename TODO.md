# TODO

- fix: https://github.com/nhn/tui.calendar/milestone/6 shows as completed, mine is 90% done
- add a changelog

## Nice to have

- reduce gql bundle size
- empty milestone/repo state
- "This milestone is overdue" and similar topbar messages
- due date on the milestone page
- link to milestone(s) from the title
- convert `x` to a Date so we don't convert multiple times over
- render milestone end date as a tick if overdue; https://apexcharts.com/docs/annotations/
- back button to navigate away from milestone page
- d3/d3 has no milestones
- use Vercel and Next.js Github auth instead of Firebase
- conventional-commit
